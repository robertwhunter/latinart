# Slowing CKD progression

## Lifestyle measures

[**Kelly et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32868398) (2021): ![](Logo_MET.png){height=1.2em} - in observational studies including over 2 million adults, factors associated with *prevention* of incident CKD were: high-K, plant-rich, low-NaCl diet; exercise, not smoking, moderate EtOH consumption.  


## Does blood pressure reduction delay **progression of kidney disease**? {#ABP_CKD}

[**AASK**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12435255) (2002): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - with 3x2 factorial design - higher (acheiving c. 140/85) *vs.* lower (achieving c. 130/80) MAP target and metoprolol *vs.* ramipril *vs.* amlodipine in African Americans with hypertensive CKDIII--IV. Rate of decline in GFR over 4 yrs did not differ between MAP target groups.  Ramipril was superior to the other agents for preventing composite of 50% reduction in GFR, ESRD, death.  See also [APOL1 nephropathy](#Apol1).  

[**Combined re-analysis of MDRD & AASK**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411082) (2020): ![](Logo_MET.png){height=1.2em} - strict ABP control delayed ESKD in patients with high (> 0.44 g/day) but not low (< 0.44 g/day) baseline proteinuria.

There was no significant effect of blood-pressure lowering on renal failure (whereas blood pressure lowering did reduce risks of MACE, coronary disease, stroke and heart failure).

## RASi & progression in non-diabetic disease

### Starting RASi

[**Jafar et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11453706) (2001): ![](Logo_MET.png){height=1.2em} - ACEi are more effective than alternative anti-hypertensives in preventing ESRF (and doubling of SCr) in non-diabetic CKD. Benefits were greater if proteinuria; unclear if benefits at PER < 0.5 g/day.  

[**Hou et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16407508) (2006): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - benazepril *vs.* placebo in non-diabetic CKD (eGFR 20--70) and proteinuria (PER > 0.3 g/day).  Benazepril reduced primary end-point (composite of doubling SCr, ESRD, death) over 3.4 yr follow-up.  Effects on primary outcome and on proteinuria independent of ABP.  

[**Xie et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26597926) (2016): ![](Logo_MET.png){height=1.2em} - Bayesian network meta-analysis of RCTs of RASi in CKD. ACEi and ARB (*vs.* placebo or active controls) reduced risk of ESRF and CVS events. ACEi  (*vs.* ARB) were associated with higher probability of preventing these outcomes.  

[**O'Hare et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24424348) (2014): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - simlation to predict real-world benefits of RASi from their RCT-proven efficacy at preventing ESKD.  Anticiapted NNTs over 3 yrs ranged from 16 (CKD IV with heavy proteinuria) to 2500 (CKD III with negligible proteinuria).

### Stopping RASi

The **STOP-ACEi** trial has not yet reported.  

[**Fu et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33372009) (2021): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - observational study in Swedish registry of CKD patients referred to nephrology (median eGFR 22).  Over 5 years, stopping RASi associated with higher rates of mortality and MACE but lower rates of rates of RRT.  


## SGLT2i {#SGLT_CKD}

See also [SGLT2i in DKD](#SGLT_DKD).  

The first large trial to confirm efficacy in non-diabetic CKD was DAPA-CKD.  

```{block2, type='box_landmark'}
[**DAPA-CKD**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32970396) (2020): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} ![](Logo_SEM.png){height=1.2em} - dapagliflozin 10 mg od *vs.* placebo in CKD (eGFR 25--75) and uACR >30.  Primary composite outcome (ESKD, doubling of SCr, death from renal or CVS cause).  T2DM in 67%.  Terminated early (median follow-up 2.4 yrs) for efficacy.  RR of primary outcome 40% lower in flozin group; NNT = 19.

[**Chertow et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34272327) (2021): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - pre-specified analysis of patients with CKD4 in DAPA-CKD.  Benefits in this group were similar to those in overall study group.  


[**Johansen & Argyropoulos**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33165977) (2020): ![](Logo_MET.png){height=1.2em} - a systematic review showed consistent cardiorenal benefits of SGLT2i in cardiovascular disease, CKD and HFrEF: a likely class effect.
