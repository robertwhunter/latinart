# Introduction {#intro}

Welcome to LATINART: **La**ndmark **T**rials **I**n **N**ephrology **A**nd **R**enal **T**ransplant.  This is an attempt to list the landmark trials in nephrology and renal transplant.

<br>

This is a highly subjective list.  A more objective catalogue can be found in the [100 most-cited articles](https://academic.oup.com/ckj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ckj/sfy033/4978347) in nephrology.  

It is also worth looking at the NephJC / RFN "top 10 stories" of...  

- [2019](http://www.nephjc.com/news/2020/1/7/the-top-nephorogy-stories-of-2019)  
- [2018](http://www.nephjc.com/news/top2018)  
- [2017](http://www.nephjc.com/news/2017/12/20/top-nephrology-related-stories-of-2017)  
- [2016](https://www.renalfellow.org/2016/12/25/top-nephrology-related-stories-of-2016_25/)  

(...and the article for 2016 has links for every year going back to 2010.)


The [renalRCTs twitter feed](https://twitter.com/renalRCTs) posts most new publications of RCTs in renal and transplant medicine.  Papers of particular interest are flagged as ["liked"](https://twitter.com/renalRCTs/likes).  


<br>

It is merely a list.  It is NOT an attempt to interpret or discuss the trials in any depth.  There are several excellent open-access resources for this such as: 

+ [NephJC](http://www.nephjc.com)  
+ [uKidney](https://ukidney.com/nephrology-resources/nephrology-articles)  
+ [Landmark nephrology](http://landmarknephrology.com)  
+ [Visualmed](https://visualmed.org)  
+ [2minutemedicine](https://www.2minutemedicine.com)  

<br>

Trials are categorised as follows:  

+ ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} = randomised controlled trial  
+ ![](Logo_MET.png){height=1.2em} = meta-analysis of RCTs  
+ ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} = observational study  
+ ![](Logo_PHY.png){height=1.2em} = physiological study (or other)  

```{block2, type='box_landmark'}
Truly landmark trials (one or two only in each chapter) are marked with stars: ![](Logo_SEM.png){height=1.2em}.
