This is an attempt to list the landmark trials in nephrology and renal transplant. 1.1 Types of study Studies are categorised as follows: = randomised controlled trial = meta-analysis of RCTs = observational study = physiological study (or other) Truly landmark studies (one or two only in each chapter) are marked with stars: . 1.2 Other lists of ‘landmark’ trials This is a subjective list. A more objective catalogue can be found in the 100 most-cited articles in nephrology. It is also worth looking at the NephJC / RFN “top 10 stories” of… 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 (…and the article for 2016 has links for every year going back to 2010.) 1.3 Going deeper This is merely a list. It is NOT an attempt to interpret or discuss the trials in any depth.

Brar et al (2018): : observational study of ~ 45,000 patients hospitalised with AKI in Canada. Prescription of RASi in the 6 months after AKI was associated with lower subsequent mortality but higher risk of hospital re-admission for a renal cause. 2.3 Other trials in AKI A well-conducted RCT dispelled the myth that dopamine could be used for renoprotection in critically ill patients: Bellomo et al. (2000): - low-dose dopamine infusion vs. placebo in critically ill patients. No protection from AKI in dopamine group. What is the effect of a complex, multi-modal intervention? TACKLING AKI (2019): - pragmatic, step-wedged RCT in ~24,000 AKI episodes: increase in AKI recognition and reduced length-of-stay but no effect on 30 day mortality and no attempt to examine longer-term outcomes. Sick day rules are not straightforward: Doerfler et al (2019): - 20 patients tested on ability to apply “sick day rules” to common scenarios. 95% of participants made errors in selecting medicines to hold.

Aycock et al. (2018): : meta-analysis of risk of AKI after contrast CT. Wilhelm-Leen et al (2017): : data-linkage to estimate risk of contrast-associated AKI in USA hospitals. A really clever trial design (regression discontinuity analysis) showed that radiocontrast for CTPA is highly unlikely to cause meaningful kidney problems in most patients. Goulden et al. (2021): - no difference in eGFR to 6 months after assessment for VTE, comparing patients just above vs just below d-dimer threshold triggering CTPA. RCTs have tested strategies for prevention of contrast-associated nephropathy: AMACING (2017): - IV 0.9% NaCl vs. placebo as contrast prophylaxis in a low-risk group. No prophylaxis was non-inferior. PRESERVE (2018): with factorial design - 1.26% NaHCO3 vs. 0.9% NaCl and oral NAC vs. placebo as contrast prophylaxis in angiography. No benefit of NaHCO3 over NaCl, nor of NAC over placebo.

ATTIRE (2021): - 20% HAS to target serum albumin 30 g/L vs standard care (HAS only for LVP, SBP, HRS) in decompensated cirrhosis. In the UK; predominantly EtOH. Composite endpoint of infection, AKI, death within 2 weeks. Median albumin dose 200 vs 20 g. Targeted HAS conferred no benefit and caused signifant harm (more pulmonary oedema / pneumonia). CONFIRM (2021): - terlipressin 1mg qds vs placebo in type I HRS (SCr &gt; 200 mcM). In the USA / Canada; predominantly EtOH. Endpoint was HRS reversal (SCr &lt; 133 mM) and survival without RRT for 10 days. Terlipressin was effective at inducing HRS reversal (17% vs 32%) but caused more adverse events including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, respiratory failure. The rates of RRT and death by 90 days were 39 and 45% respectively in the placebo group and 29 and 51% in the terlipressin group. Respiratory failure (10 vs. 3%) and death from respiratory causes (11 vs. 2%) were both more common in the terlipressin group. Prior to this, evidence supporting the use of human albumin solution for the prevention of hepatorenal syndrome came from small, single-centre RCTs: Sort et al. (1999): comparing HAS vs no HAS in SBP. Reduced renal failure and death in the HAS group. Sola-Vera et al. (2003): comparing 0.9% NaCl vs. HAS at time of large-volume paracentesis. Less circulatory dysfunction in HAS group (restricted to drain volumes \\(\\geq\\) 6L). Ditto, the use of terlipressin to treat HRS was previously supported by small, single-centre RCTs: Sanyal et al. (2009): - terlipressin vs. placebo in type 1 HRS. Treatment of HRS was greater in terlipressin group. A meta-analysis of these trials included just over 1000 patients: Wang et al. (2018): - terlipressin vs. placebo or active control in HRS. Terlipressin increases renal recovery and survival (compared to placebo, octerotide or dopamine); terlipressin and noradrenaline conferred similar benefit. 4.2 Volume status in cirrhosis Meticulous tracer studies in the 1960s showed that patients with cirrhosis have an expanded plasma volume (i.e. the commonly-encountered discription of these patients as having “interstital space overload but vascular volume depletion” is almost always a misconception): Lieberman &amp; Reynolds (1967): - plasma volume determined using 131I-albumin and 51Cr-RBCs in control patients and patients with cirrhosis. Plasma volume was expanded in patients with cirrhosis and correlated with portal venous pressure.

CKD-EPI classified fewer individuals as having CKD and was more tightly associated with risk of mortality and ESRF. (An evidence-based argument for age-specific eGFR thresholds for defining CKD was presented in 2019.) 5.2 Association of eGFR and proteinuria with hard outcomes Alberta cohort (2006): - large cohort study in general population in Canada. Adjusted rates of mortality, MI and CKD progression were all higher with increasing albuminuria. CKD prognosis consortium (2010): - large cohort study in general and high-CVS risk populations. Increasing eGFR and ACR associated with higher rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and of ESRF. 5.3 Estimating risk of CKD progression The 4-variable and 8-variable kidney failure risk equations have been used to predict risk of ESKD in CKD. The 4vKFRE has age, sex, eGFR and uACR as inputs. The 4vKFRE provides an accurate estimate of 2- and 5-yr risk of ESKD in a range of kidney diseases. Hundemer et al. (2020): - retrospective cohort study of 1200 patients with CKD in Canada. AUC &gt;0.8 on ROC curves; Brier scores ~0.17 for both 2- and 5- yrs. The KFRE is better than patients or physicians at predicting progression to ESKD. Potok et al. (2019): - relative performance of 4vKRFE, patients’ estimate and physicians’ estimate of 2 yr ESKD risk. Single-centre in California. 4vKRFE was best calibrated with actual incidence of ESKD; both physicians and patients tended to over-estimate risk. 5.4 Competing risk of death O’Hare et al (2007): - cohort of 200,000 US veterans with CKD3–5. Defined risk of death and ESRF according to age and GFR. GFR at which risk of ESRF exceeds risk of death was ~45 ml/min at age 30, ~30 ml/min at age 50 and ~15 ml/min at age 70. Ravani et al (2020): - cohort study of ~30,000 adults with CKD IV in Canada. Risk of ESKD was higher than risk of death if aged &lt; 65. Between 65 and 75 years, risks of ESKD and mortality were similar. Above this age, risk of death out-competed risk of ESKD. Relative risk of mortality (comparted to ESKD) was 6x if aged over 75 and 25x if aged over 85.

(2021): - in observational studies including over 2 million adults, factors associated with prevention of incident CKD were: high-K, plant-rich, low-NaCl diet; exercise, not smoking, moderate EtOH consumption. 6.2 Does blood pressure reduction delay progression of kidney disease? AASK (2002): - with 3x2 factorial design - higher (acheiving c. 140/85) vs. lower (achieving c. 130/80) MAP target and metoprolol vs. ramipril vs. amlodipine in African Americans with hypertensive CKDIII–IV. Rate of decline in GFR over 4 yrs did not differ between MAP target groups. Ramipril was superior to the other agents for preventing composite of 50% reduction in GFR, ESRD, death. See also APOL1 nephropathy. Combined re-analysis of MDRD &amp; AASK (2020): - strict ABP control delayed ESKD in patients with high (&gt; 0.44 g/day) but not low (&lt; 0.44 g/day) baseline proteinuria. Ettehad et al. (2016): - META-ANALYSIS of trials of anti-hypertensive therapy (total &gt;600,000 patients). There was no significant effect of blood-pressure lowering on renal failure (whereas blood pressure lowering did reduce risks of MACE, coronary disease, stroke and heart failure). 6.3 RASi &amp; progression in non-diabetic disease 6.3.1 Starting RASi Jafar et al (2001): - ACEi are more effective than alternative anti-hypertensives in preventing ESRF (and doubling of SCr) in non-diabetic CKD. Benefits were greater if proteinuria; unclear if benefits at PER &lt; 0.5 g/day. Hou et al (2006): - benazepril vs. placebo in non-diabetic CKD (eGFR 20–70) and proteinuria (PER &gt; 0.3 g/day). Benazepril reduced primary end-point (composite of doubling SCr, ESRD, death) over 3.4 yr follow-up. Effects on primary outcome and on proteinuria independent of ABP. Xie et al (2016): - Bayesian network meta-analysis of RCTs of RASi in CKD. ACEi and ARB (vs. placebo or active controls) reduced risk of ESRF and CVS events. ACEi (vs. ARB) were associated with higher probability of preventing these outcomes. O’Hare et al. (2014): - simlation to predict real-world benefits of RASi from their RCT-proven efficacy at preventing ESKD. Anticiapted NNTs over 3 yrs ranged from 16 (CKD IV with heavy proteinuria) to 2500 (CKD III with negligible proteinuria). See also RASi in DKD. See also trials of RASi in heart failure. 6.3.2 Stopping RASi STOP-ACEi (2022): - open-label RCT of ACEi withdrawal in progressive CKD4 (n = 420). ESKD in 60%; CVS events in 50%; deaths in 10%. No difference in these outcomes between two groups. Fu et al. (2021): - observational study in Swedish registry of CKD patients referred to nephrology (median eGFR 22). Over 5 years, stopping RASi associated with higher rates of mortality and MACE but lower rates of rates of RRT. 6.4 SGLT2i See also SGLT2i in DKD. The first large trial to confirm efficacy in non-diabetic CKD was DAPA-CKD. DAPA-CKD (2020): - dapagliflozin 10 mg od vs. placebo in CKD (eGFR 25–75) and uACR &gt;30. Primary composite outcome (ESKD, doubling of SCr, death from renal or CVS cause). T2DM in 67%. Terminated early (median follow-up 2.4 yrs) for efficacy. RR of primary outcome 40% lower in flozin group; NNT = 19. This was confirmed in EMPA-KIDNEY, in a trial population that included patients with lower levels of eGFR and albuminuria. EMPA-KIDNEY (2022): - empagliflozin 10 mg od vs. placebo in CKD (either eGFR 20 – 45 or eGFR 45 – 90 and uACR &gt; 20 mg/mmol). Stopped early for efficacy. Empagliflozin reduced composite outcome (CKD progression, renal mortality, cardiovascular mortality) by 30%. Effect similar in diabetic and non-diabetic participants. Great safety profile (higher rate of discontinuation in the placebo arm). Absolute benefit lower in patients with lower levels of albuminuria. Improvements in GFR slope were observed at all levels of albuminuria (even uACR &lt; 3 mg/mmol) - although the magnitude of this effect is greater at higher levels (and of course absolute benefit will also increase in this group as cardiovascular event rate is higher). There was no significant benefit in the primary outcome or in the kidney disease progression outcome when uACR &lt; 30 mg/mmol - but there were low event rates in these groups. Chertow et al. (2021): - pre-specified analysis of patients with CKD4 in DAPA-CKD. Benefits in this group were similar to those in overall study group. Johansen &amp; Argyropoulos (2020): - a systematic review showed consistent cardiorenal benefits of SGLT2i in cardiovascular disease, CKD and HFrEF: a likely class effect. Cardio-renal consortium meta-analysis (2022): - meta-analysis of 13 RCTs in 90,000 participants. SGLT2i RRRs for progressive CKD = 40%, for AKI = 20%, for cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalisation = 20%, for cardiovascular death = 10%. Effect sizes similar in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. The sensitivity analysis on p16 of the supplemental material is worth looking at. This shows that beneficial effect (i.e. RRR) with respect to kidney outcomes (ESKD or AKI) does not vary according between trials in association with mean uACR. However, the absolute event rate (and hence the absolute benefit of SGLT2i) does, as expected. In trials with mean uACR &lt;3 , 3 – 30 or &gt;30 mg/mmol, rates of ESKD were respectively ~5, 15 and 50 events per 1000 patient years in the placebo groups. There are very limited data on patients without diabetes and uACR &lt;30 mg/mmol (so for these trial populations, estimate of effect size crosses the null).

DCCT (1993): - intensive vs. conventional insulin therapy in T1DM (achieving HbA1c ~7 vs. ~9 %). Intensive control reduced risk of micro- and overt albuminuria (and retinopathy). Frequent hypos in the intensive group (in the era of isophane insulin). UKPDS 33 (1998): - intensive vs. conventional glycaemic control in T2DM (achieving HbA1c ~7.0 vs. ~7.9 %; n ~5000). Intensive control reduced risk of microalbuminuria. 10-year follow-up data from UKPDS (in 2008) showed that early good glycaemic control exerted a beneficial “legacy” effect on micro-vascular outcomes, MI and death whereas early good ABP control did not exert a legacy benefit. STENO-2 (2017): conventional management vs. multi-factorial intervention in T2DM with microalbuminuria. Multi-factorial intervention conferred benefits for nephropathy, retinopathy and autonomic neuropathy. 7.2 RAS blockade RASi slow progression in DM with overt albuminuria. Lewis et al. (1993): - captopril vs. placebo in T1DM with PER &gt; 0.5 g/day. Captopril delayed time to doubling of SCr and reduced risk of composite of death and ESRF independent of effects on blood pressure. IDNT (2001): - irbesartan vs. amlodipine vs. placebo in T2DM with HTN and PER &gt; 0.9 g/day. Irbesartan reduced risk of composite (doubling of SCr, ESRF, death) compared to both other groups. Effects independent of blood-pressure. RENAAL (2001): - losartan vs. placebo in T2DM and ACR &gt; 30 or PER &gt; 0.5 g/day. Losartan reduced risk of composite end-point (doubling SCr, ESRF, death). Effects independent of blood-pressure. RASi slow progression to overt nephropathy in microalbuminuria: ACEi in DN Trialist Group (2001): - ACEi delay progression to overt albuminuria in T1DM and microalbuminuria. Parving et al. (2001): - irbesartan vs. placebo in T2DM with HTN and microalbuminuria. Irbesartan delayed progression to overt albuminuria. Are RASi beneficial even before the onset of microalbuminuria? ROADMAP (2011): - olmesartan vs. placebo in T2DM without microalbuminuria. In the olmesartan group, there was delayed onset of microalbuminuria but a greater number of cardiovascular deaths. 7.3 Dual RAAS blockade Dual RAAS blockade increases the risk of adverse events: VA NEPHRON-D (2013): - losartan plus placebo vs losartan plus lisinopril in T2DM and ACR &gt; 30. Terminated early for safety concerns. No benefit from dual RAS blockade (on composite of change in eGFR, ESRF and mortality) but increased risk of AKI and hyperkalaemia.

Primary composite outcome (ESKD, doubling of SCr, death from renal or CVS cause). Terminated early (median follow-up 2.6 yrs) because of efficacy. RR of primary outcome 30% lower in flozin group. Also reductions in risk of ESKD, CVS death, MI, CVA, hospitalisation for CCF. EMPA-REG (2016): - empagliflozin vs. placebo in T2DM with eGFR &gt;30. Mean GFR 74; ACR &lt; 3 in 60%. Empagliflozin slowed rate of decline in eGFR and progression to ESRF. CANVAS (2018): - canagliflozin vs. placebo in T2DM for primary and secondary prevention of CVS events and renal composite outcome (40% reducing in eGFR, RRT, death). Canagliflozin reduced CVS and renal events in both primary and secondary prevention cohorts. 7.5 GLP1ra FLOW (2024): - semaglutide 1 mg weekly s.c. vs placebo in T2DM with CKD and albuminuria (eGFR 25 – 75 with albuminuria). n = 3500. 95% on RASi; 15% on SGLT2i. Primary composite outcome (ESKD, 50% reducton in eGFR, renal or CVS death). RRR ~25% for primary outcome; 20% reduction in all-cause mortality. No safety signal. 7.6 Four pillars Neuen at al.

Three large RCTs of erythorpoetin therapy established that conservative Hb targets are associated with better hard outcomes. CREATE (2006): - target Hb 10.5–11.5 vs. 13.0–15.0 in CKD3–4.

IV iron targeting higher ferritin (400–600 mcg/L) was more effective than oral iron at delaying the need for other anaemia management. Adverse events similar between groups. REVOKE (2015): - oral vs. IV iron in CKD 3–4. Trial terminated early due to high numbers of adverse events (infections / CVS) in the IV iron group. PIVOTAL (2018): - high-dose proactive vs. low-dose reactive IV iron sucrose in HD patients.

Several trials have attempted to refine the lower limit (of blood pressure and CVS risk) at which treatment is beneficial: ACCORD (2010): - systolic target &lt;140 vs. &lt;120 mmHg in patients with T2DM. Intensive control did not reduce rates of primary composite outcome (non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death) but was associated with more adverse events. (NB there was also an intensive vs. conventional glycaemic control study.) SPRINT (2015): - systolic target &lt;140 vs. &lt;120 mmHg in patients with ABP &gt;130 and increased CVS risk but NOT diabetes. Intensive control reduced risk of primary composite outcome (MI, ACS, stroke, heart-failure, cardiovascular death). NB - when the final trial data were analysed in 2021 after some additional outcomes had been adjudicated, the benefits were broadly similar. Rates of AKI, electrolyte abnormalities and syncope were higher in the intestive control group. SPRINT - CKD subgroup (2017): pre-specified CKD subgroup in SPRINT trial. CKD did not modify effects on primary outcome; renal outcomes did not differ between treatment arms. Why did results of SPRINT and ACCORD differ? Perhaps ACCORD was relatively under-powered; perhaps it reflects differences in study population (e.g. greater proportion of heart failure in SPRINT). HOPE-3 (2016): with factorial design - candesartan plus hydrochlorothiazide vs placebo in patients with intermediate CVS risk. No difference in primary outcome (MI, stroke, cardiovascular death). There was a benefit in pre-specified subgroup: those with ABP in upper third = systolic &gt;143.5 mmHg. (There was also rosuvastatin vs. placebo comparison which was effective in this intermediate risk group.) 10.3 Mode of intervention What is the best way to monitor blood pressure? Agarwal et al. (2011): - home-based blood pressure monitoring (compared to office-based) results in lower systolic blood pressure and less therapeutic inertia. Can life-style intervention achieve blood pressure reduction? DASH (1997): - effect of high-fruit, low-fat diet on blood pressure. Blood pressure was lower on the intervention diet. Choice of anti-hypertensive agent: are some better than others at preventing cardiovascular events? ALLHAT (2002): - chlorthalidone vs. amlodipine vs. lisinopril in patients \\(\\geq\\) 65 yrs with one other RF. No difference in primary outcome (fatal and non-fatal MI). Blood pressure was lower in chlorthalidone group. Some secondary outcomes were better in chlorthalidone group. LEGEND-HTN (2019): - large-scale analysis of real-world data in ~ 5 million first-time users of anti-hypertensives. Thiazides better than ACEi at preventing MI, stroke hospitalisation for CCF. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs were inferior to all other classes of anti-hypertensive. Is dual RAS blockade more effective than single-agent blockade? ONTARGET (2008): - telmisartan, ramipril or both in patients with diabetes or vascular disease. No benefit of dual RAS blockade (on primary composite cardiovascular outcome) but increased risk of syncope and renal failure. See also dual RASi in diabetic nephropathy. Does timing of anti-hypertensive therapy matter? No it does not! TIME (2022): - morning vs. evening dosing of anti-hypertensives (n = 20,000). No difference in primary composite cardiovascular outcome. NB - The high-profile HYGIA trial had major methodological flaws. 10.4 Special populations Is anti-hypertensive therapy beneficial in the very elderly? HYVET (2008): - anti-hypertensive therapy (with indapamide +/- perindopril) vs. placebo in the very elderly (\\(\\geq\\) 80 yrs) with ABP &gt;160 systolic. The treatment group had a reduction in the rate of fatal and non-fatal stroke and fewer adverse events. What is the best strategy in resistant hypertension? PATHWAY-2 (2015): - cross-over RCT - spironolactone vs. bisoprolol vs. doxazosin m/r vs. placebo in hypertensive patinets already on three agents. Spironolactone was the most effective at lowering blood pressure. 10.5 Renal dennervation SYMPLICITY HTN-3 (2014): - renal denervation vs. sham procedure in resistant hypertension.

(2014): - electronic monitoring of adherence to immunosuppressive medications after kidney transplant. Early non-adherance was associated with acute rejection and graft loss. 23.2 Desensitisation Two landmark trials showed that desensitisation offers a survival advantage to patients (comparted to matched cohort waiting for a compatible kidney): Montgomery et al. (2011): - single-centre outcomes after desensisation in HLAi transplants. Orandi et al. (2016): - multi-centre outcomes after desensitations in HLAi transplants. 23.3 Rejection Nickeleit et al. (1998): - case-series of ~100 patients with acute cellular rejection. “Vascular rejection” (with endarteritis) was less responsive to steroid treatment but responded equally well to treatment with TDAs - compared to rejection without endarteritis.

Oral therapy was non-inferior. IMPACT (2010): - 100 vs. 200 days of valganciclovir prophylaxis in D+R- transplants. Fewer cases of CMV disease by 2 years in the 200-day group. 24.2 CVS risk ALERT (2003): - fluvastatin vs. placebo in KTRs. Statin therapy for 5 yrs did not significantly reduce the primary end-point (MACE) but did reduce cardiac death and non-fatal MI.

No difference in mortality at 28 days. In patients with pre-existing HTN, high-target group required less RRT. RCTs testing the complex intervention of early goal-directed therapy: RIVERS et al (2001): comparing early goal-directed therapy vs. usual care in septic shock (n=263). In-hospital mortality lower in EGDT group. PRISM meta-analysis (2017): - patient-level meta-analysis of ProCESS, ARISE and ProMISE trials of EGDT vs. usual care in septic shock (n=3723). No benefit (for 90-day mortality) for EGDT. See also section on IV fluids. 27.2 Cardiology HOPE (2000): - ramipril vs. placebo in high-risk patients with vascular disease or diabetes (but not known HFrEF). Rampril reduced risk of death, MI and stroke. CONSENSUS (1987): - enalapril vs. placebo in NYHA class IV CCF. Mortality benefit seen in enalapril group. SOLVD (1991): - enalapril vs. placebo in patients with HFrEF (EF &lt; 0.35) - predominantly NYHA II and III. Enalapril reduced all-cause mortality and rates of hospitalisation for and death from heart failure. 27.3 Haematology BRIDGE (2015): LMWH vs. placebo for peri-operative “bridging anticoagulation” in patients warfarinised for AF. Placebo was non-inferior w.r.t. risk of CVA, VTE or TIA and superior w.r.t. risk of major bleeding.
