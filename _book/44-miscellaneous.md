## Myeloma
[**MYRE**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29209721) (2017): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - high-cuttoff dialyser *vs.* conventional dialyser in myeloma cast nephropathy.  No difference in dialysis-independence at 3 months.  

[**EuLITE**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872075) (2019): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - HCO *vs.* conventional dialysis in cast nephropathy requiring dialysis: open-label, phase 2 trial.  All patients treated with bortezomib-based regime.  No significant difference in the primary outcome of dialysis-independence at 90 days.    


## Pregnancy

[**Hladunewich et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24525032) (2014): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - pregnancy outcomes in women with ESRF receiving intensive dialysis (Toronto cohort) compared to a comparitor cohort receiving conventional dialysis.  Fetal outcomes were better in the intensive dialysis group.  

[**CHIPS**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25629739) (2015): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - tight (target DBP <85 mmHg) *vs.* less tight (DBP <100 mmHg) ABP control in pregnant women with non-proteinuric HTN.  No difference in maternal and fetal outcomes; less severe hypertension in the tight control group.  

[**Harel et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30644975) (2019): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - normal range for SCr in pregnancy.  


## AIN
[**Gonzalez et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18185501) (2008): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - retrospective analysis of drug-induced interstitial nephritis. Early treatment with steroids was associated with better renal recovery.  


## Tuberous sclerosis
[**Bissler et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18184959) (2008): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - Open label trial of sirolimus with angiomyolipomata (in TSC or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis). Angiomyolipoma volume decreased during sirolimus treatment.  

## Other
[**Groopman et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30586318) (2019): ![](Logo_PHY.png){height=1.2em} - Exome-sequencing of ~3000 patients with CKD (including ~280 patients with unknown aetiology).  Diagnostic variants were detected in ~9% of the whole cohort / 17% of patients with unknown aetiology of CKD / 24% of patients with congenital or cystic disease.  Commonest variants in PKD1/2, COL4A3/4/5, UMOD.
