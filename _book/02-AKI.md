## Association of AKI with mortality & morbidity

[**Chertow et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16177006) (2005): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em}: association of AKI with mortality.  

[**Sawhney et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28061831) (2017): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em}: AKI predicts 90-day re-adnission; pulmonary oedema is commonest cause of re-admission.  

[**Brar et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30422153) (2018): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em}: observational study of \~ 45,000 patients hospitalised with AKI in Canada.  Prescription of RASi in the 6 months after AKI was associated with lower subsequent mortality but higher risk of hospital re-admission for a renal cause.  


## Other trials in AKI

A well-conducted RCT **dispelled the myth** that dopamine could be used for renoprotection in critically ill patients:

[**Bellomo et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11191541) (2000): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - low-dose dopamine infusion *vs.* placebo in critically ill patients.  No protection from AKI in dopamine group.   


What is the effect of a complex, multi-modal intervention?  

[**TACKLING AKI**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058607) (2019): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - pragmatic, step-wedged RCT in ~24,000 AKI episodes: increase in AKI recognition and reduced length-of-stay but no effect on 30 day mortality and no attempt to examine longer-term outcomes.  


Sick day rules are not straightforward:

[**Doerfler et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867156) (2019): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - 20 patients tested on ability to apply "sick day rules" to common scenarios.  95% of participants made errors in selecting medicines to hold.
