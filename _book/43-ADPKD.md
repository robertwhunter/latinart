# ADPKD

## Blood pressure targets and RASi

[**HALT-PKD (early)**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25399733) (2014): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} with factorial design - standard (<130/80) *vs.* intensive (<110/75) ABP target and lisinopril plus telmisartan *vs.* lisinoprol plus placebo in ADPKD with eGFR >60. In the intensive blood pressure control group there was slower increase in kidney volume and a greater decline in LV mass index and albuminuria (but more hypotensive symptoms). There was no benefit of dual RAS blockade.

[**HALT-PKD (late)**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25399731) (2014): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - lisinopril plus telmisartan *vs.* lisinopril plus placebo in ADPKD with eGFR 25--60.  There was no benefit of dual RAS blockade (in time to death, ESRF or 50% reduction in eGFR).  


## Vasopressin antagonist therapy

Tolvaptan slowed rate of increase in kidney volume and decline in 1/Cr over 3 years; there were more adverse events in the tolvaptan group.

[**REPRISE**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29105594) (2017): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - tolvaptan *vs.* placebo in ADPKD with eGFR 25--65 (or 25--44 if aged over 56).  Tolvaptan slowed rate of decline in eGFR over 1 year; there were more elevations in ALT in the tolvaptan group.
