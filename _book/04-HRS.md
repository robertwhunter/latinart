# Hepatorenal syndrome

## HAS and vasopressors

In 2021, two large multi-centre RCTs tested the role of **human albumin solution** and **terlipressin** in type I HRS.

In the UK; predominantly EtOH.  Composite endpoint of infection, AKI, death within 2 weeks.  Median albumin dose 200 *vs* 20 g.  Targeted HAS conferred no benefit and caused signifant harm (more pulmonary oedema / pneumonia).  
  
[**CONFIRM**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657294) (2021): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} ![](Logo_SEM.png){height=1.2em} - terlipressin 1mg qds *vs* placebo in type I HRS (SCr > 200 mcM).  In the USA / Canada; predominantly EtOH.  Endpoint was HRS reversal (SCr < 133 mM) and survival without RRT for 10 days.  Terlipressin was effective at inducing HRS reversal (17% *vs* 32%) but caused more adverse events including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, respiratory failure.  The rates of RRT and death by 90 days were 39 and 45% respectively in the placebo group and 29 and 51% in the terlipressin group.  Respiratory failure (10 vs. 3%) and death from respiratory causes (11 vs. 2%) were both more common in the terlipressin group.

Prior to this, evidence supporting the use of **human albumin solution** for the prevention of hepatorenal syndrome came from small, single-centre RCTs:

[**Sort et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10432325) (1999): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} comparing HAS *vs* no HAS in SBP. Reduced renal failure and death in the HAS group.  

[**Sola-Vera et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12717396) (2003): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} comparing 0.9% NaCl *vs.* HAS at time of large-volume paracentesis. Less circulatory dysfunction in HAS group (restricted to drain volumes $\geq$ 6L).  


Ditto, the use of **terlipressin** to treat HRS was previously supported by small, single-centre RCTs:

[**Sanyal et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18471513) (2009): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - terlipressin *vs.* placebo in type 1 HRS. Treatment of HRS was greater in terlipressin group.  


A meta-analysis of these trials included just over 1000 patients: 

[**Wang et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29668606) (2018): ![](Logo_MET.png){height=1.2em} - terlipressin *vs.* placebo or active control in HRS. Terlipressin increases renal recovery and survival (compared to placebo, octerotide or dopamine); terlipressin and noradrenaline conferred similar benefit.   

## Volume status in cirrhosis

Meticulous tracer studies in the 1960s showed that patients with cirrhosis have an expanded plasma volume (i.e. the commonly-encountered discription of these patients as having "interstital space overload but vascular volume depletion" is almost always a misconception): 

[**Lieberman & Reynolds**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16695918) (1967): ![](Logo_PHY.png){height=1.2em} - plasma volume determined using ^131^I-albumin and ^51^Cr-RBCs in control patients and patients with cirrhosis.  Plasma volume was expanded in patients with cirrhosis and correlated with portal venous pressure.
