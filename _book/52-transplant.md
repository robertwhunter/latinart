# Transplant

## Donors

### Donor types

Generally good outcomes have been observed for living unrelated donors and DCD donors:

[**Terasaki et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7609748) (1995): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - outcomes in living unrelated transplants.  

[**Snoeijs et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20488954) (2010): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - survival benefit of DCD kidney. 

[**Summers et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20727576) (2010): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - UK transplant registry data showed 5-yr outcomes from DCD donors equivalent to DBD donors.  


### Donor AKI

In deceased donors, donor AKI is associated with non-inferior outcomes in some cohorts.  Severe donor AKI (AKIN 3) is associated with worse graft function at 1 yr and increased rates of primary non-function.  Mild donor AKI (AKIN 1 and 2) is associated with generally good long-term graft function:    

[**Boffa et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27428556) (2017): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - UK registry data.  

[**Hall et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30470437) (2019): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - US cohorts.  


### Ischaemic time

Observational studies have examined the effects of cold and warm ischaemic time on patient and graft outcomes: 

[**Debout et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229341) (2015): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - longer cold-ischaemic time was associated with worse graft survival and higher mortality in recipients of DBD kidneys (French cohort).  

[**Gill et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28433384) (2017): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - CIT of up to 16 hrs was not associated with graft loss in recipients of kidneys from living donors (large Canadian cohort).  


## Immunosuppression

Contemporary immunosuppressive regimes (basiliximab, pred, MMF, low-dose tacro) are supported by the ELITE-Symphony trial:

\BeginKnitrBlock{box_landmark}<div class="box_landmark">[**ELITE-Symphony**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18094377) (2007): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} ![](Logo_SEM.png){height=1.2em} - comparing standard-dose CsA *vs.* low-dose tacro *vs.* low-dose CsA *vs.* low-dose sirolimus.  
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{box_landmark}

Alternative regimes designed to avoid or minimise steroids and CNIs have been tested:

[**BENEFIT**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26816011) (2016): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - CsA *vs.* belatacept (high- and low-dose groups).  At 7 years, graft suvival, patient survival and GFR were higher in the belatacept groups.  

[**HARMONY**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27871759) (2016): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - rATG with steroid withdrawal *vs.* basiliximab with steroid withdrawal *vs.* basliximab with maintenence steroid in patients with low immunological risk.  rATG was non-inferior (for acute rejection); fewer cases of diabetes in steroid-withdrawal groups.  

[**3C**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25078310) (2014): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - alemtuzumab (steroid-free, low-CNI, low-MMF) *vs.* basiliximab induction then re-randomisation at 6 months to tacro *vs.* sirolimus.  Less rejection in the alemtuzumab group with similar rates of infection in the first 12 months.  The comparison between tacro and sirolimus [reported separately](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29226570) showed no difference in eGFR at 18 months but more infections and rejection with sirolimus.  

[**CONVERT**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19155978) (2009): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - sirolimus *vs.* CNI in maintenance phase.  In patients with GFR > 40 ml/min, in the sirolimus group: GFR at 2 yrs was higher, risk of malignancy was lower, proteinuria was higher.  Recruitment of patients with GFR < 40 halted early due to excess adverse events in sirolimus group.  


Non-adherance is not infrequent and predicts renal outcomes.  

[**Nevins et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831921) (2014): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - electronic monitoring of adherence to immunosuppressive medications after kidney transplant. Early non-adherance was associated with acute rejection and graft loss.  


## Desensitisation

Two landmark trials showed that desensitisation offers a survival advantage to patients (comparted to matched cohort waiting for a compatible kidney):

[**Montgomery et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21793744) (2011): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - single-centre outcomes after desensisation in HLAi transplants. 

[**Orandi et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26962729) (2016): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - multi-centre outcomes after desensitations in HLAi transplants.  


## CMV disease

[**VICTOR**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17640310) (2007): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - IV ganciclovir *vs.* oral valganciclovir for non-severe CMV disease.  Oral therapy was non-inferior.  

[**IMPACT**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21197713) (2010): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - 100 *vs.* 200 days of valganciclovir prophylaxis in D+R- transplants.  Fewer cases of CMV disease by 2 years in the 200-day group.  


## CVS risk {#statin_Tx}

[**ALERT**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12814712) (2003): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - fluvastatin *vs.* placebo in KTRs. Statin therapy for 5 yrs did not significantly reduce the primary end-point (MACE) but did reduce cardiac death and non-fatal MI.  


## Rejection

[**Nickeleit et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9644642) (1998): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - case-series of ~100 patients with acute cellular rejection.  "Vascular rejection" (with endarteritis) was less responsive to steroid treatment but responded equally well to treatment with TDAs - compared to rejection without endarteritis.
