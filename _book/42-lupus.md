# Lupus nephritis

## Induction

Induction regimes using **cyclophosphamide** are more effective than steroids alone: 

\BeginKnitrBlock{box_landmark}<div class="box_landmark">[**Austin et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3511372) (1986): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} ![](Logo_SEM.png){height=1.2em} - IV CYC plus steroids *vs.* steroids alone in lupus nephritis. Cyclophosphamide delayed progression to ESRF.

[**NIH study**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8815753) (1996): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - pulsed IV CYC *vs.* pulsed IV steroids *vs.* both in proliferative lupus nephritis. Steroids alone were less effective at inducing remission.  

[**Euro-Lupus**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12209517) (2002) and [10-yr follow-up](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19155235) (2010): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - high-dose *vs.* low-dose cyclophosphamide induction (with azathioprine maintenance) in proliferative lupus nephritis. Low-dose regime was non-inferior.  

**MMF for induction** is non-inferior to cyclophosphamide:

[**Ginzler et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16306519) (2005): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - MMF *vs.* IV cyclophosphamide in lupus nephritis (class III--V). MMF was more effetive than cyclophosphamide at inducing remission. 

\BeginKnitrBlock{box_landmark}<div class="box_landmark">[**ALMS**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19369404) (2009): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} ![](Logo_SEM.png){height=1.2em} - MMF *vs.* IV cyclophosphamide in lupus nephritis (class III--V). MMF was non-inferior.

*Post-hoc* [subgroup analysis or ALMS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23375819) suggest MMF may be superior when GFR <30.  On the other hand [meta-analyses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22879439) suggests greater relapse rate after MMF.  


Contemporary protocols favour relatively less **steroid**:  

[**MYLUPUS**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21976398) (2011): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - standard-dose (starting ~1 mg/kg/day) *vs.* low-dose (starting ~0.5 mg/kg/day) pred in proliferative LN.  Both groups treated with enteric-coated mycophenolate (~720 mg bd then tid).  Small study (n = 40 + 40) but similar efficacy at inducing remission by 6 months.  


## Maintenance & adjunctive Rx

MMF is superior to aza in maintenance:
[**Dooley et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22087680) (2011): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - MMF (2g/day) *vs* aza (2 mg/kg/day) for maintenance of remission in lupus nephritis.  MMF superior at maintaining remission (treatment failure during 3 year follow-up ~16 *vs* 32%) and associated with fewer serious adverse events.  

[**Canadian HCQ trial**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1984192) (1991): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - withdrawal *vs* continuation of HCQ in stable lupus.  Withdrawal lead to ~2.5x risk of lupus flare.  


## Newer therapies

### B-cell therapies

**Rituximab** may be an alternative option in steroid-sparing regimes and for rescue therapy.  

[**LUNAR**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22231479) (2012): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - rituximab *vs.* placebo in proliferative lupus nephritis (alongside MMF and steroids).  No difference in primary end-point (of renal response at 1 year).  

**RITUXILUP** - not yet reported.  

**Belimumab** targets B-cell activating factor (BAFF, aka B-lymphocyte stimulator, BLyS).  

[**BLISS-LN**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937045) (2020): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - belimumab *vs* placebo (plus standard induction with CYC / MMF) in lupus nephritis.  Primary outcome was changed after study registration.  Final primary outcome was uPCR < 100 with stable eGFR and no rescue Rx at 2 yrs.  Belimumab was efficacious (40 vs. 30% primary end-point) with good safety profile.  The results would not have been statistically significant for the original primary end-point (complete / partial / non-response).  



### CNIs

[**Multi-target therapy**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25383558/) (2015): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - tacro + MMF + steroid *vs* IV CYC + steroid in Chinese population (n = 368).  Tacro and MMF induced greater complete remission (25 *vs* 45 %) at 24 weeks.  

[**AURORA**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33971155) (2021): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - voclosporin *vs* placebo in lupus nephritis, in addition to MMF and pred.  Primary endpoint was complete renal remission at 1 yr.  Voclosporin was effective (primary endpoint in ~40 vs. 20%) with no safety signal.  Primary endpoint dominated by proteinuria response which may of course be haemodynamic.  


## Glucocorticoid toxicity

[**Apostolopoulos et al.**](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2665-9913(19)30105-5) (2020): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - cohort study in South-East Asia / Australasia (n = 1700): in patients with SLE (of whom 50% had baseline kidney disease - not necessarily lupus nephritis), glucocorticoid use was associated with damage accrual, independent of disease activity.
