# Transplant - immunosuppression & rejection

## Immunosuppression

Contemporary immunosuppressive regimes (basiliximab, pred, MMF, low-dose tacro) are supported by the ELITE-Symphony trial:

Alternative regimes designed to avoid or minimise steroids and CNIs have been tested:

[**BENEFIT**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26816011) (2016): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - CsA *vs.* belatacept (high- and low-dose groups).  At 7 years, graft suvival, patient survival and GFR were higher in the belatacept groups.  

[**HARMONY**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27871759) (2016): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - rATG with steroid withdrawal *vs.* basiliximab with steroid withdrawal *vs.* basliximab with maintenence steroid in patients with low immunological risk.  rATG was non-inferior (for acute rejection); fewer cases of diabetes in steroid-withdrawal groups.  

[**3C**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25078310) (2014): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - alemtuzumab (steroid-free, low-CNI, low-MMF) *vs.* basiliximab induction then re-randomisation at 6 months to tacro *vs.* sirolimus.  Less rejection in the alemtuzumab group with similar rates of infection in the first 12 months.  The comparison between tacro and sirolimus [reported separately](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29226570) showed no difference in eGFR at 18 months but more infections and rejection with sirolimus.  

[**CONVERT**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19155978) (2009): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - sirolimus *vs.* CNI in maintenance phase.  In patients with GFR > 40 ml/min, in the sirolimus group: GFR at 2 yrs was higher, risk of malignancy was lower, proteinuria was higher.  Recruitment of patients with GFR < 40 halted early due to excess adverse events in sirolimus group.  


Non-adherance is not infrequent and predicts renal outcomes.  

[**Nevins et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24831921) (2014): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - electronic monitoring of adherence to immunosuppressive medications after kidney transplant. Early non-adherance was associated with acute rejection and graft loss.  


## Desensitisation

Two landmark trials showed that desensitisation offers a survival advantage to patients (comparted to matched cohort waiting for a compatible kidney):

[**Montgomery et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21793744) (2011): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - single-centre outcomes after desensisation in HLAi transplants. 

[**Orandi et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26962729) (2016): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - multi-centre outcomes after desensitations in HLAi transplants.  


## Rejection

[**Nickeleit et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9644642) (1998): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - case-series of ~100 patients with acute cellular rejection.  "Vascular rejection" (with endarteritis) was less responsive to steroid treatment but responded equally well to treatment with TDAs - compared to rejection without endarteritis.
