# CKD & proteinuria 

## eGFR calculation

[**CKD-EPI**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22570462) (2012): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - comparison of CKD-EPI and MDRD in a meta-analysis of data from over 1 million adults followed for a median of over 7 years.  CKD-EPI classified fewer individuals as having CKD and was more tightly associated with risk of mortality and ESRF.  


## Association of eGFR and proteinuria with hard outcomes

[**Alberta cohort**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20124537) (2006): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - large cohort study in general population in Canada.  Adjusted rates of mortality, MI and CKD progression were all higher with increasing albuminuria.

Increasing eGFR and ACR associated with higher rates of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and of ESRF.

## Competing risk of death  

[**O'Hare et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17855638) (2007): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - cohort of 200,000 US veterans with CKD3--5.  Defined risk of death and ESRF according to age and GFR.  GFR at which risk of ESRF exceeds risk of death was ~45 ml/min at age 30, ~30 ml/min at age 50 and ~15 ml/min at age 70.

## RASi & progression in non-diabetic disease

[**Jafar et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11453706) (2001): ![](Logo_MET.png){height=1.2em} - ACEi are more effective than alternative anti-hypertensives in preventing ESRF (and doubling of SCr) in non-diabetic CKD. Benefits were greater if proteinuria; unclear if benefits at PER < 0.5 g/day.  

[**Hou et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16407508) (2006): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - benazepril *vs.* placebo in non-diabetic CKD (eGFR 20--70) and proteinuria (PER > 0.3 g/day).  Benazepril reduced primary end-point (composite of doubling SCr, ESRD, death) over 3.4 yr follow-up.  Effects on primary outcome and on proteinuria independent of ABP.  

[**Xie et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26597926) (2016): ![](Logo_MET.png){height=1.2em} - Bayesian network meta-analysis of RCTs of RASi in CKD. ACEi and ARB (*vs.* placebo or active controls) reduced risk of ESRF and CVS events. ACEi  (*vs.* ARB) were associated with higher probability of preventing these outcomes.
