## Association of AKI with mortality & morbidity

[**Chertow et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16177006) (2005): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em}: association of AKI with mortality.  

[**Sawhney et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28061831) (2017): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em}: AKI predicts 90-day re-adnission; pulmonary oedema is commonest cause of re-admission.  

[**Brar et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30422153) (2018): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em}: observational study of \~ 45,000 patients hospitalised with AKI in Canada.  Prescription of RASi in the 6 months after AKI was associated with lower subsequent mortality but higher risk of hospital re-admission for a renal cause.  


## Contrast-associated nephropathy

Large observational studies have defined the **risk** of contrast-associated nephropathy with conventional CT-scanning protocols.  

[**Aycock et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28811122) (2018): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em}: meta-analysis of risk of AKI after contrast CT.  

[**Wilhelm-Leen et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27688297) (2017): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em}: data-linkage to estimate risk of contrast-associated AKI in USA hospitals.  


RCTs have tested strategies for **prevention** of contrast-associated nephropathy:

[**AMACING**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28233565) (2017): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - IV 0.9% NaCl *vs.* placebo as contrast prophylaxis in a low-risk group.  No prophylaxis was non-inferior.  

[**PRESERVE**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29130810) (2018): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} with factorial design - 1.26% NaHCO~3~ *vs.* 0.9% NaCl and oral NAC *vs.* placebo as contrast prophylaxis in angiography. No benefit of NaHCO~3~ over NaCl, nor of NAC over placebo.  


## Hepatorenal syndrome

Evidence supporting the use of **human albumin solution** for the prevention of hepatorenal syndrome from small, single-centre RCTs:

[**Sort et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10432325) (1999): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} comparing HAS *vs* no HAS in SBP. Reduced renal failure and death in the HAS group.  

[**Sola-Vera et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12717396) (2003): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} comparing 0.9% NaCl *vs.* HAS at time of large-volume paracentesis. Less circulatory dysfunction in HAS group (restricted to drain volumes $\geq$ 6L).  

Use of **terlipressin** to treat HRS supported by small, single-centre RCTs:

[**Sanyal et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18471513) (2009): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - terlipressin *vs.* placebo in type 1 HRS. Treatment of HRS was greater in terlipressin group.  

A meta-analysis of these trials included just over 1000 patients: 

[**Wang et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29668606) (2018): ![](Logo_MET.png){height=1.2em} - terlipressin *vs.* placebo or active control in HRS. Terlipressin increases renal recovery and survival (compared to placebo, octerotide or dopamine); terlipressin and noradrenaline conferred similar benefit.   


Meticulous tracer studies in the 1960s showed that patients with cirrhosis have an expanded plasma volume (i.e. the commonly-encountered discription of these patients as having "interstital space overload but vascular volume depletion" is almost always a misconception): 

[**Lieberman & Reynolds**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16695918) (1967): ![](Logo_PHY.png){height=1.2em} - plasma volume determined using ^131^I-albumin and ^51^Cr-RBCs in control patients and patients with cirrhosis.  Plasma volume was expanded in patients with cirrhosis and correlated with portal venous pressure.  

## Other trials in AKI

A well-conducted RCT **dispelled the myth** that dopamine could be used for renoprotection in critically ill patients:

[**Bellomo et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11191541) (2000): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - low-dose dopamine infusion *vs.* placebo in critically ill patients.  No protection from AKI in dopamine group.   


What is the effect of a complex, multi-modal intervention?  

[**TACKLING AKI**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31058607) (2019): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - pragmatic, step-wedged RCT in ~24,000 AKI episodes: increase in AKI recognition and reduced length-of-stay but no effect on 30 day mortality and no attempt to examine longer-term outcomes.  


Sick day rules are not straightforward:

[**Doerfler et al**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30867156) (2019): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - 20 patients tested on ability to apply "sick day rules" to common scenarios.  95% of participants made errors in selecting medicines to hold.
