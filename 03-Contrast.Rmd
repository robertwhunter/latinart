# Contrast-associated nephropathy

Large observational studies have defined the **risk** of contrast-associated nephropathy with conventional CT-scanning protocols.  

[**Aycock et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28811122) (2018): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em}: meta-analysis of risk of AKI after contrast CT.

A really clever trial design (regression discontinuity analysis) showed that radiocontrast for CTPA is highly unlikely to cause meaningful kidney problems in most patients.  

[**Goulden et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33818606) (2021): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - no difference in eGFR to 6 months after assessment for VTE, comparing patients just above *vs* just below d-dimer threshold triggering CTPA.  


RCTs have tested strategies for **prevention** of contrast-associated nephropathy:

[**AMACING**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28233565) (2017): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - IV 0.9% NaCl *vs.* placebo as contrast prophylaxis in a low-risk group.  No prophylaxis was non-inferior.  

[**PRESERVE**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29130810) (2018): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} with factorial design - 1.26% NaHCO~3~ *vs.* 0.9% NaCl and oral NAC *vs.* placebo as contrast prophylaxis in angiography. No benefit of NaHCO~3~ over NaCl, nor of NAC over placebo.
