## Erythropoetin

One small RCT suggested that conservative Hb targets might be associated with better hard outcomes.  (See commentary from [Daniel Coyne](https://ajkdblog.org/2016/04/03/nephmadness-2016/).)  

[**Normal Haematocrit Trial**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9718377) (1998): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - target HCT 0.42 *vs.* 0.30.  Higher rates of death and non-fatal MI in the higher target group.  

Three large RCTs of erythorpoetin therapy established that conservative **Hb targets** are associated with better hard outcomes.  

[**CREATE**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17108342) (2006): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - target Hb 10.5--11.5 *vs.* 13.0--15.0 in CKD3--4. No difference in rates of cardiovascular events.

[**TREAT**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19880844) (2009): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} ![](Logo_SEM.png){height=1.2em} - darbepoetin *vs.* placebo to target Hb 13 *vs.* 9 in CKD with T2DM. Increased risk of stroke in the higher-target group.

## Iron

[**FIND-CKD**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24891437) (2014): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - IV iron targeting lower *vs.* higher ferritin *vs* oral iron in non-dialysis CKD.  IV iron targeting higher ferritin (400--600 mcg/L) was more effective than oral iron at delaying the need for other anaemia management.  Adverse events similar between groups.   

[**REVOKE**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26083656) (2015): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - oral *vs.* IV iron in CKD 3--4.  Trial terminated early due to high numbers of adverse events (infections / CVS) in the IV iron group.  

[**PIVOTAL**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30365356) (2018): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - high-dose proactive *vs.* low-dose reactive IV iron sucrose in HD patients.  Iron given unless ferritin > 700 or Tsats $\geq$ 40% in high-dose group or if ferritin < 200 or Tsats <20% in low-dose group.  Primary CVS end-point (MI, stroke, CCF, death).  Fewer patients in the high-dose group reached primary end-point; mean ESA dose lower in high-dose group.
