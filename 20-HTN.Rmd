## Hypertension

The benefit of treating ABP in high CVS risk and at systolic >160 mmHg is established.  Several trials have attempted to **refine the lower limit** (of blood pressure and CVS risk) at which treatment is beneficial:

[**ACCORD**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20228401) (2010): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em}  - systolic target <140 *vs.* <120 mmHg in patients with T2DM. Intensive control did not reduce rates of primary composite outcome (non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death) but was associated with more adverse events. (NB there was also an intensive *vs.* conventional glycaemic control study.)  

```{block2, type='box_landmark'}
[**SPRINT**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26551272) (2015): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} ![](Logo_SEM.png){height=1.2em} - systolic target <140 *vs.* <120 mmHg in patients with ABP >130 and increased CVS risk but NOT diabetes. Intensive control reduced risk of primary composite outcome (MI, ACS, stroke, heart-failure, cardiovascular death).  

```

[**SPRINT - CKD subgroup**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28642330) (2017): pre-specified CKD subgroup in SPRINT trial. CKD did not modify effects on primary outcome; renal outcomes did not differ between treatment arms.  

Why did results of SPRINT and ACCORD differ?  Perhaps ACCORD was relatively under-powered; perhaps it reflects differences in study population (e.g. greater proportion of heart failure in SPRINT).  


[**HOPE-3**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27041480) (2016): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em}  with factorial design - candesartan plus hydrochlorothiazide *vs* placebo in patients with intermediate CVS risk. No difference in primary outcome (MI, stroke, cardiovascular death).  There was a benefit in pre-specified subgroup: those with ABP in upper third = systolic >143.5 mmHg.  (There was also rosuvastatin *vs.* placebo comparison which was effective in this intermediate risk group.)

Can **life-style intervention** achieve blood pressure reduction?

[**DASH**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9099655) (1997): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - effect of high-fruit, low-fat diet on blood pressure. Blood pressure was lower on the intervention diet.

**Choice of anti-hypertensive agent**: are some better than others at preventing cardiovascular events?

```{block2, type='box_landmark'}
[**ALLHAT**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12479763) (2002): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} ![](Logo_SEM.png){height=1.2em} - chlorthalidone *vs.* amlodipine *vs.* lisinopril in patients $\geq$ 65 yrs with one other RF. No difference in primary outcome (fatal and non-fatal MI). Blood pressure was lower in chlorthalidone group. Some secondary outcomes were better in chlorthalidone group.  

```

[**LEGEND-HTN**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668726) (2019): ![](Logo_MET.png){height=1.2em} - large-scale analysis of real-world data in \~ 5 million first-time users of anti-hypertensives.  Thiazides better than ACEi at preventing MI, stroke hospitalisation for CCF.  Non-dihydropyridine CCBs were inferior to all other classes of anti-hypertensive.

Is **dual RAS blockade** more effective than single-agent blockade?

[**ONTARGET**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18378520) (2008): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - telmisartan, ramipril or both in patients with diabetes or vascular disease. No benefit of dual RAS blockade (on primary composite cardiovascular outcome) but increased risk of syncope and renal failure.

Is anti-hypertensive therapy beneficial in the **very elderly**?

[**HYVET**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18378519) (2008): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em}  - anti-hypertensive therapy (with indapamide +/- perindopril) *vs.* placebo in the very elderly ($\geq$ 80 yrs) with ABP >160 systolic. The treatment group had a reduction in the rate of fatal and non-fatal stroke and fewer adverse events.

Does blood pressure reduction delay **progression of hypertensive kidney disease**?

[**AASK**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12435255) (2002): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em}  with 3x2 factorial design - higher (acheiving c. 140/85) *vs.* lower (achieving c. 130/80) MAP target and metoprolol *vs.* ramipril *vs.* amlodipine in African Americans with hypertensive CKDIII--IV. Rate of decline in GFR over 4 yrs did not differ between MAP target groups.  Ramipril was superior to the other agents for preventing composite of 50% reduction in GFR, ESRD, death.  See also [APOL1 nephropathy](#Apol1).

[**Ettehad et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26724178) (2016): ![](Logo_MET.png){height=1.2em} ![](Logo_SEM.png){height=1.2em} - META-ANALYSIS of trials of anti-hypertensive therapy (total >600,000 patients). There was no significant effect of blood-pressure lowering on renal failure (whereas blood pressure lowering did reduce risks of MACE, coronary disease, stroke and heart failure).

What is the best way to **monitor blood pressure**?  

[**Agarwal et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21115879) (2011): ![](Logo_MET.png){height=1.2em} - home-based blood pressure monitoring (compared to office-based) results in lower systolic blood pressure and less therapeutic inertia.  


What is the best strategy in **resistant hypertension**?

[**PATHWAY-2**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26414968) (2015): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - cross-over RCT - spironolactone *vs.* bisoprolol *vs.* doxazosin m/r *vs.* placebo in hypertensive patinets already on three agents. Spironolactone was the most effective at lowering blood pressure.  


Does timing of anti-hypertensive therapy matter?  

The **TIME** trial is currently recruiting.

[**HYGIA**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641769) (2019): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - \~ 19,000 patients randomised to take anti-hypertensives at bedtime or on waking.  Bedtime dosing reduced rate of MI, CVA and CVS death (HR \~ 0.6 over 6 yrs follow-up).

## Statins

```{block2, type='box_landmark'}
[**SHARP**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21663949) (2011): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} ![](Logo_SEM.png){height=1.2em} - simvastatin & ezetimibe *vs.* placebo for primary prevention in CKD. Treatment group had fewer major cardiovascular events.

## Cardiovascular risk

[**Khera et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27959714) (2016): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - interaction between genetic risk (from polygenic risk score) and lifestyle with respect to risk of coronary events in over 50,000 subjects. Genetic risk and lifestyle factors independently associate with rates of coronary artery disease. Healthy lifestyle defined as non-smoker, BMI < 30, weekly physical activity and diet rich in fruits, nuts, veg, fish and low in processed foods.  

[**Li et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29712712) (2018): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - association of lifestyle factors with life expectancy from age of 50 in USA. Lifestyle factors = not smoking, > 30 mins per day of moderate exercise (including brisk walking), moderate EtOH intake, BMI 19 - 25, healthy diet.  Projected gain of 2.5 - 2.8 years per lifestyle factor (additive).  


## Renal dennervation

[**SYMPLICITY HTN-3**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24678939) (2014): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - renal denervation *vs.* sham procedure in resistant hypertension. No difference in office or ambulatory blood pressure at 6 months.  


## Renovascular disease

Two large RCTs found **no benefit of revascularisation** in atherosclerotic renal artery disease.  

```{block2, type='box_landmark'}
[**ASTRAL**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19907042) (2009): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} ![](Logo_SEM.png){height=1.2em} - revascularisation *vs.* medical therapy alone in atherosclerotic renal artery disease. No benefit from revascularisation.  

```

[**CORAL**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24245566) (2014): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - revascularisation *vs.* medical therapy alone in atherosclerotic renal artery disease. No benefit from revascularisation.
