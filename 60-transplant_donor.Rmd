# Transplant - donors

## Donor types

Generally good outcomes have been observed for living unrelated donors and DCD donors:

[**Terasaki et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7609748) (1995): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - outcomes in living unrelated transplants.  

[**Snoeijs et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20488954) (2010): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - survival benefit of DCD kidney. 

[**Summers et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20727576) (2010): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - UK transplant registry data showed 5-yr outcomes from DCD donors equivalent to DBD donors.  


## Donor AKI

In deceased donors, donor AKI is associated with non-inferior outcomes in some cohorts.  Severe donor AKI (AKIN 3) is associated with worse graft function at 1 yr and increased rates of primary non-function.  Mild donor AKI (AKIN 1 and 2) is associated with generally good long-term graft function:

[**Hall et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30470437) (2019): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - US cohorts.  


## Ischaemic time

Observational studies have examined the effects of cold and warm ischaemic time on patient and graft outcomes: 

[**Debout et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229341) (2015): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - longer cold-ischaemic time was associated with worse graft survival and higher mortality in recipients of DBD kidneys (French cohort).  

[**Gill et al.**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28433384) (2017): ![](Logo_OBS.png){height=1.2em} - CIT of up to 16 hrs was not associated with graft loss in recipients of kidneys from living donors (large Canadian cohort).
