## Coronary intervention

[**ISCHAEMIA-CKD**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32227756) (2020): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - PCI *vs* medical Rx in CKD IV/V with stable myocardial ischaemia (confirmed on stress testing).  Excluded if recent ACS or heart failure.  ~60% had T2DM, ~50% were on dialysis.  Primary composite outcome of death and non-fatal MI over median follow-up of just over 2 yrs.  Invasive strategy had no benefit and caused increase rates of stroke.  

## AFib

[**VALKYRIE**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33753537) (2021): ![](Logo_RCT.png){height=1.2em} - warfarin *vs* rivaroxaban 10 mg od *vs* rivaroxaban plus vit K for AFib on HD.  Primary composite endpoint of fatal and non-fatal CVS events.  Rivaroxaban was efficacious for the primary endpoint (HR ~0.4) and also caused less major bleeding (HR ~0.4).  Reduced rates of limb ischaemia accounted for most of benefit in primary end-point.
